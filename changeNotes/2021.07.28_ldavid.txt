Subject: Cruise file generation and BGC (Bio-Geochemical Cycles) Model code removed

Name: Lance David

Date: 07/28/2021

Variants affected: All

Description: The Cruise File generation controlled by the CRUZFILE keyword was
             used as input to a post processor that is no longer available and
             code for this has been removed.
             The BGC model had not been included in any FVS build for over 5
             years and was part of a special project that came to an end. With
             no expectation of future use, code related to the BGC extension 
             was removed to keep the FVS base model clean.

Impact on users: None because these options were not used.

Files:
base\Fvs.f 
                Removed “CALL NATCRZ (1)” directly following call to FVSSTD
                at original line numbers 290 and 373 .

base\keywds.f 
                Removed CRUZFILE from table. Location can be reused in 
                association with option number 120 in initre.f.
                Removed BGCIN from table. Location can be reused in
                association with option number 114 in initre.f.

vbase\cuts.f
                Removed “CALL NATCRZ (2)” following FVSSTD process at line
                number 1675.

vbase\initre.f 
                CruzFile keyword occupied option number 120 and statement
                label 12000 in the computed “GO TO” statement. Those are
                now available for reuse. It was also an activity using
                activity code 205 which is now available for reuse.

                BGCin keyword occupied option number 114 and statement label
                11400 in the computed “GO TO” statement. Those are now
                available for reuse.
                BGC extension has been retired.
                Associated with this keyword was also a call to BGCIN for
                keyword processing and a call to BGCINT for initialization
                of the BGC extension which is now defunct.

vbase\natcrz.f
                This subroutine has been retired and will be moved to archive
                folder after removal from all other variants.

BGC (Bio-Geochemical Cycles) Model links removal 

base\exbgc.f –  This was the stub routine for builds not including BGC. it was
                removed from source list files referenced above and will be
                moved to archive folder after it has been removed from all
                variants. It was used as a guide to locate link points
                throughout FVS source code.

base\gradd.f –  Removed LBGCGO variable from parameter list
                Removed LBGCGO variable from declarations

            Code following CALL HTGSTP removed
            C
            C     CALL BGCFVS IF REPLACING INCREMENTS AND MORTALITY WITH THOSE
            C     FROM STAND-BGC.
            C
                  IF(LBGCGO)CALL BGCFVS(1)

            Code following CALL CROWN removed
            C
            C     IF STAND-BGC IS ACTIVE, REPLACE CROWN CHANGE ESTIMATES IF
            C     BGC ESTIMATES ARE BEING USED.
            C

            Code following CALL DFBGO removed
            C
            C     CALL BGCGO TO SEE IF STAND-BGC IS ACTIVE
            C
                  CALL BGCGO(LBGCGO)

            Code following CALL FFERT removed
            C
