Subject: Ratio of Standard Errors Reporting and Calibration Process Correction

Variants affected: All

Description: The RATIO OF STANDARD ERRORS in the CALIBRATION STATISTICS table
             in the main output file contained a value other than 1.00 for
             species that had diameter growth measurements in the input data
             when no calibration (NoCalib) was specified. This was due to input
             measurement counts being used when they should not. Projection
             results for a dataset with too few growth measurements (per 
             individual species) should be identical to no growth mesurements
             or use of NoCalib keyword. This modification makes it so.

Impact on users: Users who specify No Calibration for datasets that contain
                 diameter growth measurments will see minor differences in
                 results. Differences observed during testing was considered
                 very slight.
