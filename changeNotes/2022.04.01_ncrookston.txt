Name: NLCrookston
Date: April 1, 2022
Variants affected: All

Description: 
Added a stop point 7, returns after the trees are read, but prior to dubbing
of missing measurements. Added api calles to set/get multipliers via the 
fvsSpeciesAttributes code.

Impact on users: Additional funtionality is provided, everything is backwards compatible
so there is only impact on users who take advantage of the additional functionality.
